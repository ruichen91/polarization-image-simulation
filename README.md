Close form of polarization images simulation based on TRS (Transmitted Reflectance Sinusoid) physical model.

- Input contains an image of an object and its normal image.
- Output synthesized polarization images. 
- Perfect for diffuse and metal materials

- The document is not written in English, but the equations are self-explainary. Feel free to reach out if you need some explanation.
